In the last twenty-twenty five years, the Indian lifestyle has become very complex. One of the reasons is that one-person earning does not support the current lifestyle standards and which is why both the parents need to be working. Second, because economic opportunities are diverse and widespread, and parents often have to travel to metro cities for work, leaving the support system of their grandparents behind. And which is why there has also been a mushrooming of day care centres for kids in mega cities like Gurugram and Bangalore because of the influx of the financially sound and very well-educated immigrants. 

And with all of these complexities that surround the lives of the adults, it becomes understandable that the parents might find it difficult to manage time and narrate a bed-time story to their young ones.

But you should still go ahead and do it because of the benefits listed below:

**A.	Putting your child to peaceful sleep:** A good picture book would help your child feel easy by creating a positive atmosphere for them before they go off to sleep. For many children reading stories or listening to narration by the parents is actually therapeutic. 

**B.	Creating a life-long habit of reading:** A lot of studies talk about how adults and children alike should switch off the screen around them at least 30-45 minutes before they plan to sleep each day. Getting ready to listen to an interesting picture book story ensures that children would develop a life-long habit where they would learn to shun the screen before they sleep, and actually read for 30-40 minutes.

**C.	Provides an opportunity for bonding:** If you havenâ€™t had the time to give attention to your child all day and especially if they go to a day-care centre, then reading stories to them at night-time would be fabulous opportunity for the parents to bond with their children. If both the parents are working then each of them can narrate stories to their children on alternate days. Otherwise, the one that does not get to spend more time with the child, could be a more permanent narrator than the other. This could also serve as a platform for more consistent communication for the kids.

**D.	Social and emotional development:** A lot of picture books deal with emotional and social themes surrounding the lives of young children. Also, considering that not many children are very articulate about their feelings when they are young, picture book stories are a great way to help young children understand themselves and their world a little better.

**E.	Cognitive Skills and increase in knowledge:** Through stories children develop cognitive and comprehension skills early in life and which can prove to be extremely beneficial in all spheres of life, and especially when it comes to complimenting their school education.

**F.	Personality development and value-education:** A lot of picture books centre around universal themes like friendship, courage, following your passions, and some of them are based on the age-old wisdom of the world fables and fairy tales. For parents especially, it becomes easy to introduce the child to concepts like empathy, compassion, kindness, selflessness and motivation if they read a story revolving around these themes to their children.

Help your children grow and learn about the world one story at a time. Happy reading!
