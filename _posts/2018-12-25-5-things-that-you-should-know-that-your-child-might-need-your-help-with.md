The world has not just become amazingly complex for you but also your children. To help your child navigate the modern world, we have come up with the top 5 areas of concern that you must be aware of where your children might need your help.

Here are the top five things that kids are concerened today with and parents should know about:

**a. Making the right friends:**

A lot of times, the social atmosphere and the peer pressure gets to your child and she might get confused between choosing friends. Though, for some parents this might be trivial but at the age that your child is at, choosing between friends could be heartbreaking. 

Talk to your kids regularly and asking them about their friends and friend circle, and when a time comes in the child's life that she might have to move to new places (either physically or emotionally), you will be there with the right information in your head, and help the child make one of the most recurrent but most important decisions in their life.

**b. Choosing area of interests:**

It is not just about the area of study or the profession that she should be undertaking, but also the interest that they need to develop in their life. What most parents at times fail to understand is that an interest in field is just as important as supportive siblings. 

Familes with two kids will understand how much they would want their kids to stay together and with one another through the course of their lives and even after their lives. Interests are also like that. Once you chose a particular interest in your life, it becomes a life-long friend. It is the constant companion that moves with you throughout your age. Whether you are in school, in college, in job but that one particular interest will always stay with you.

**c. Talking to elders:**

Parents are the bridge between the older generations and the younger generation. If your child or your parent have trouble getting along, then probably you need to set in to make things right. Some of the older parents will remember the Raj Kapoor movie 'Kal Aaj aur Kal' which had the central theme of the clash between the generations and the Raj Kapoor, the father of Rishi Kapoor and the son of Prithviraj Kapoor.

**d. Creating an amazing public persona:**

When children grow up, they become aware of how the general public perceives them as. It becomes very important to help your children develop personalities where they can easily negotiate the brickbats that they might get along the way, and balance with all the bouquets that they might receive. The idea is to ensure that no matter the success or the failure, or the people who surround them, it is important that they stay grounded.

**e. The books and media that you children should be consuming:**

Today we have been bombarded with information in the form of media which generations before us were not. Choosing not just the right media of consumption, the amount of time is not the only things that are important. What is even more important is knowing the kinds of books that your children should reading, or the shows that your children should be watching.
